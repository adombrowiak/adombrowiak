## Professional & Enterprise-Focused Projects

The repositories below represent professionally oriented projects focused on enterprise IT systems, access management, and technology risk. These projects are designed to reflect real-world organizational considerations rather than academic lab environments.

**Remote Access Management**  
Enterprise-focused documentation and analysis of remote access governance, identity integration, operational risk, and control design.  

Repository: [Remote Access Management](https://github.com/adombrowiak/remote-access-management)

**Technology Risk & Controls**  
Enterprise-focused documentation and analysis of technology risk identification, control objectives, and governance within IT systems.  

Repository: [Technology Risk & Controls](https://github.com/adombrowiak/technology-risk-and-controls)

Additional enterprise-focused projects are in progress.

## Academic Background & Graduate Projects

The items below represent selected academic work completed as part of my graduate program. These projects are retained for reference and demonstrate foundational knowledge across systems security, access controls, digital forensics, and risk analysis. They are academic in nature and do not represent production enterprise implementations.

The project materials below are provided as PDF or PowerPoint documents generated as part of academic coursework.

### CST 630 – Advanced Cyber Exploitation and Mitigation Methodologies  
**Focus area:** Vulnerability analysis and security assessment reporting

This course consisted of a cumulative assessment document developed over an 11-week period. The work emphasized vulnerability identification, assessment documentation, and executive-level reporting rather than tool-specific exploitation techniques.
