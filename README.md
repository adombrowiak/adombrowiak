- <b>CST 630: Advanced Cyber Exploitation and Mitgation Methodologies</b></br>
For this class set of projects, it was working on the same document over the 11 week course.</br>
You can find the completed document [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17345988/dombrowiak._CST630_Project4.pdf).
  - Project 1: Reconnaissance
    - Pages edited were 5-16 
    - In this lab, you will act as a professional penetration tester to assess the security of a client’s IT infrastructure by identifying and exploiting potential vulnerabilities in web applications, computer systems, and internal networks. Your objective is to evaluate the client’s security posture, document the findings, and provide a detailed penetration testing report to the organization's leadership. The lab will require the use of preinstalled tools in the MARS virtual lab environment to complete the testing and reporting.
  - Project 2: Discovery
    - Pages edited were 4-5, 8, 17-26
    - This lab builds on the previous one, positioning you as a member of a cybersecurity team tasked with conducting penetration testing to assess your client’s IT infrastructure. The goal is to identify and evaluate vulnerabilities in areas such as web applications, computer systems, and internal networks that could be exploited by attackers. Your client is worried about security weaknesses that may affect their internal security posture and pose risks to the organization. Throughout the course, you will analyze the security of your client’s network and exploit identified vulnerabilities.
  - Project 3: Exploitation
    - Pages edited were 7-9, 17-29
    - This lab continues from previous sessions, focusing on a cybersecurity team's role in penetration testing (pen testing) to assess a client's IT infrastructure for vulnerabilities. The client is worried about potential security issues that could affect their internal security and overall risk. In this lab, students will evaluate the internal network's security and document their findings in a Penetration Test Report using a provided template. Participants will utilize various pre-installed tools in the MARS virtual lab environment to conduct the testing.
  - Project 4: Cleanup & Reporting
    - Pages edited were 6-30
    - The post-exploitation cleanup and reporting phase involves compiling findings from Projects 1, 2, and 3. As a member of a cybersecurity team conducting penetration testing, you've assessed your client's IT infrastructure and identified vulnerabilities in their network security.
- <b>CST 640: Digital Forensics Technology and Practices</b></br>
For this class, each project is a PowerPoint presentation. Each project will be linked to downloading the finished PowerPoint.
  - [Project 1: A network Intrusion](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17831942/dombrowiak_CST64_Project1.pptx)
    - Here we discusses a security breach analysis stemming from poor administrative practices. It highlights the vulnerability created by storing Base64-encoded credentials in a hidden, non-indexed folder, which an attacker exposed using a directory-scanning tool. The attacker reversed the encoding to gain system access, emphasizing the importance of robust security measures such as encryption and multi-factor authentication. The presentation also outlines tools like Kali Linux and CyberChef used for forensic analysis and recommends improved policies to prevent such intrusions.
  - [Project 2: The Hacker Attacks](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17831987/dombrowiak_CST640_Project2.pptx)
    - In this project, it simulates a hacker attack using tools like Dirb and Nmap to exploit hidden directories, SSH, and RDP vulnerabilities. It demonstrates privilege escalation techniques, persistent access methods (e.g., scheduled tasks, startup scripts), and data exfiltration via encrypted SSH tunnels. Forensic artifacts such as altered logs and malicious scripts were generated to trace attacker actions and methods. The project underscores the importance of securing credentials, hardening services, and maintaining robust intrusion detection and prevention systems.

- <b>CYB 670: Cybersecurity Capstone</b></br>
  - [Project Documentation](https://github.com/adombrowiak/Capstone.git)
    - Created a detailed threat intelligence report using tools like AlienVault OTX, Cisco Talos, VirusTotal, and Google Dorking to find Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</br>
    - Performed network and DNS reconnaissance with Nmap and Kali Linux enumeration tools (dnsenum, dnsmap, dnsrecon, fierce) to map subdomains, identify vulnerabilities, and evaluate infrastructure exposure.</br>
    - Conducted cross-validation of threat data across various intelligence platforms, identifying discrepancies and ensuring accurate risk assessments.</br>
    - Provided actionable recommendations on website access, malware quarantine, and vulnerability exploitation scenarios, aligning findings with NIST CSF and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks.</br>
    - Delivered a comprehensive analytical report showcasing the integration of tactical, operational, and strategic threat intelligence into incident response workflows.</br>
