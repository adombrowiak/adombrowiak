## About Me

My name is [Aaron Dombrowiak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-dombrowiak/). I am an IT and information systems professional with a focus on enterprise systems, technology risk, and identity and access management. My background combines academic training and hands-on experience centered on how organizations design, operate, and govern reliable and secure IT environments.

I hold a B.S. in Cyber Defense from Davenport University and an M.S. in Cybersecurity Technologies from the University of Maryland Global Campus. I am also CompTIA Security+ certified. My work and studies emphasize understanding how systems function at scale, identifying operational and access-related risks, and implementing controls that balance security, usability, and business needs.

My professional interests sit at the intersection of IT systems analysis, technology risk and controls, and identity and access management. I approach security as an enabling function that supports system reliability, audit readiness, and informed decision-making rather than operating in isolation.

## Academic Background & Graduate Projects

The items below represent selected academic work completed as part of my graduate program. These projects are retained for reference and demonstrate foundational knowledge across systems security, access controls, digital forensics, and risk analysis. They are academic in nature and do not represent production enterprise implementations.

The project materials below are provided as PDF or PowerPoint documents generated as part of academic coursework.

### CST 630 – Advanced Cyber Exploitation and Mitigation Methodologies  
**Focus area:** Vulnerability analysis and security assessment reporting

This course consisted of a cumulative assessment document developed over an 11-week period. The work emphasized vulnerability identification, assessment documentation, and executive-level reporting rather than tool-specific exploitation techniques.
