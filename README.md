<h1>Hello, and welcome to my GitHub Profile!</h1>

<h3>About me</h3>

My name is Aaron Dombrowiak, and I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in both education and hands-on experience. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Cyber Defense from Davenport University and am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Cybersecurity Technology at the University of Maryland. In addition to my academic background, I am Security+ certified, and continuously advancing my skills and knowledge through studying for certifications like CISSP and CySA+. My commitment to this field is unwavering, and I am always eager to learn and grow. 

Driven by a passion for safeguarding digital assets, I specialize in protecting sensitive information and ensuring secure infrastructures. My goal is to leverage my expertise in cybersecurity to help organizations implement robust security frameworks, promoting a safer digital landscape for everyone.

On here I'll be adding all the documentation I have done for each of my graduate courses, along with a little summary on what to expect from the project.

Thank you for stopping by!
